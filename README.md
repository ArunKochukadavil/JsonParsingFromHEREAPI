# JsonParsingFromHEREAPI
When we are using the geocoding API, the API sends response in form of JSON/XML/CSV etc. In this project, I have parsed the json-
-string which was given as a response from HEREAPI.
I am doing this project in C# Dotnet Framework.
There are some packages you need to install before using this project for any purpose:
From NuGet Package Manager install : Newtonsoft.Json

Save your app_id and app_code in a text file and save it in a text file name location.txt which is in directory bin/Debug/location.txt

If you don't have app_id and app_code go and register on HERE API and get your freemium plan there and keys from there as of date 9-2-18, you will get 250k transaction free on HERE API per month.
