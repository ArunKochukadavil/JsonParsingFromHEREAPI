# JsonParsingFromHEREAPI
When we are using the geocoding API, the API sends response in form of JSON/XML/CSV etc. In this project, I have parsed the json-
-string which was given as a response from HEREAPI.
I am doing this project in C# Dotnet Framework.
There are some packages you need to install before using this project for any purpose:
From NuGet Package Manager install : Newtonsoft.Json
